# üßë‚Äçüíª Contributor Code of Conduct

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors, maintainers, and users interacting with the **DuskProbe** project, including but not limited to GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and third-party integrations. It governs behavior in both public and private channels associated with the project.

---

## Principles

We are building a security tool. That means we hold ourselves to a higher standard of integrity, precision, and responsibility. Contributors are expected to:

- **Operate ethically**: Use DuskProbe only for authorized security testing.
- **Communicate professionally**: Treat others with respect, regardless of technical skill level.
- **Collaborate constructively**: Provide actionable feedback and technical insight.
- **Document thoroughly**: Ensure code, commits, and issues are well-commented and reproducible.
- **Secure by design**: Avoid introducing insecure patterns, dependencies, or logic.

---

## Technical Expectations

To maintain a high-quality codebase and community, contributors must:

- Follow established coding standards (PEP8 for Python).
- Write modular, testable, and maintainable code.
- Include unit tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Avoid hardcoded secrets, credentials, or scanning payloads.
- Respect rate limits and avoid denial-of-service behavior.
- Use reproducible environments (e.g., requirements.txt, Dockerfiles).
- Ensure all contributions pass CI/CD checks before merging.

---

## Prohibited Conduct

The following behaviors are grounds for removal from the project:

- Submitting malicious code, exploits, or unauthorized payloads.
- Using DuskProbe for black-hat activities or scanning without consent.
- Sharing private or personally identifiable information (PII).
- Harassing or belittling contributors based on technical ability, background, or identity.
- Spamming issues, pull requests, or discussions with irrelevant content.
- Circumventing project security mechanisms or moderation policies.

---

## Reporting Violations

Violations of this Code of Conduct should be reported to the project maintainer.

Reports will be handled confidentially and investigated promptly. Maintainers reserve the right to ban users, revoke access, or escalate to platform administrators if necessary.

---

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take any action deemed necessary to enforce this Code of Conduct, including:

- Warning or suspending contributors
- Reverting malicious commits
- Locking or removing discussions
- Banning repeat offenders
- Updating this policy as needed

---

## Ethical Reminder

DuskProbe is a **white-hat tool**. It is intended for **educational and authorized** security testing only. Any use outside of legal boundaries or without explicit permission is strictly prohibited and may be subject to criminal prosecution.

---

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, with additional provisions for cybersecurity and technical rigor.
