##  Writing and Running Tests

- All test files are located in the `/tests` directory.
- Use `unittest` or `pytest` to write and run tests.

```bash
pytest tests/
```

- Create a test for every new module or function.
- Mock HTTP responses using `requests-mock` or similar libraries.

##  Documentation Updates

- Documentation lives in the `docs/` directory and the main `README.md`.
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code.
- Use Markdown syntax for formatting.
- For new features, document usage examples and configuration changes.
